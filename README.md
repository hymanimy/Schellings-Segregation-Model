# Schellings-Segregation-Model

This is a simulation of Schelling's Segregation Model from the 70's. In the model we have 2 types of people which are represented by red and blue cells in a grid. Green cells indicate no one is living there. In the model, similar to real life, blue people would like a certain percentage of their neighbours to be blue and the same goes for red. If the percentage of similar neighbours drops below their threshhold, the person will move to an empty space (green) in the hopes of becoming satisfied with their new location. 

Every tick of the simulation, all the unsatisfied people (cells) move. The simulation terminates when all cells are satisfied. 

The blue people that blue citizens want to be beside is called the ratio of similarity, this can be varied by the slider given. Dimensions can also be changed using a slider. 

The simulation can be used to show how a population with basic wants (the want to be around a certain proportion of similar humans) can end up segregated despite innocent intentions.
